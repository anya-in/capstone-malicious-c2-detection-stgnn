# capstone-malicious-c2-detection-stgnn
Our ECH-resilient ST-GNN detects hidden malware like Sliver C2 by identifying "Fingerprints of Intent" in encrypted traffic rhythms. Using FFT-based isolation and INT8 quantization, we achieve >98% precision and &lt;10ms latency on 2025 datasets, proving that security can be robust without compromising user privacy or needing decryption.
